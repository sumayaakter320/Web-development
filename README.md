    A local server, often referred to as a local development server or simply a localhost, is a server that runs on a local machine, such as a personal computer, for the purpose of developing and testing web applications.

    Common software tools used to set up a local server environment include:

        - XAMPP (cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl)

    </p>

  - Live server
    <p>
    The term "live server" typically refers to a server that is actively hosting and serving live, publicly accessible web applications or websites over the internet. A live server is in contrast to a local development server, which is used by developers for testing and development purposes on their local machines.
